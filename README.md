# Novyi-Svit-game
This project was created due to the rapidly increasing popularity of video games and the increasing societal attention to mental health issues. The purpose of the project is to help people cope with anxiety giving the feeling of helpful escapism with video games. Also it is intended to spread awareness of those issues and offer players a sense of collective commiseration. </br>

The player experience is supposed to vary depending on a specific level of the game. Particular attention was paid to the color palette and the background music to enhance embedded emotional response.</br>

The game was implemented with the use of the Unity game engine and C#. MySQL was chosen as a relational database to store game data and PHP was used to get information from the database.</br>
